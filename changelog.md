changelog v1.0 17-11-2025

solid base but needs work

lots of testing has gone into making this a thing its 95% and in theory should just work

ive added all commands that need to be a thing the last time i tested the whole system installed fine to the folder i set 

but this was without squashfs cretion commands iso creation commands and extra calamares commands that ive added 

their is 1 file i need to add for calamares e.g mount.conf for btrfs level 22 compression and i will be changing my iso theme for the isos

i will be up in morning todo this but for now why not try yourself if you want just use install command at bottom of this github repo
